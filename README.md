# Full Stack User Management System
This is a comprehensive full-stack user management application.
## User Roles: Admin and Regular User
In this application, users are divided into two roles: administrators and regular users. Administrators have the authority to manage all user information, including adding, updating, deleting, and querying, while regular users can only perform actions on their own information.
## Frontend Application
The frontend application focuses on delivering an exceptional user experience. We have employed Bootstrap 5 for styling, resulting in a modern, responsive interface. The application flow is as follows:
### Login Page: 
Users are initially presented with options to log in, reset their passwords, or register.
### After Login:
Both administrators and regular users can access the management interface, which includes functions for adding, updating, viewing, and deleting user profiles.
## Backend Application
The backend application leverages Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL database to implement REST APIs. It supports CRUD operations on user models and incorporates the following features:
1. Exception handling
2. Data access repositories
3. Controllers to handle HTTP requests
## Frontend-Backend Integration
To facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend, we use the following code configuration (located in the Spring MVC module of the Java Spring framework):
